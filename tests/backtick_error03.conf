# This is defcon configuration file testing backtick substitution
#
# The test is about overly long value error conditions. It uses a specially
# crafted test file, tests/backtick_error01.longfile, which was generated
# with the compiled in 4096 byte value limit in mind, in the following way:
#
# perl -e 'print("." x 4097);' >tests/backtick_error01.longfile
#
# The resulting file is exactly 4097 byte long. The associated tests,
# backtick_error01 and backtick_error02, contain --EXPECT-- sections
# with a carefully chosen number of '.' characters to match that.
#
# If the value of VALUELEN in php_defcon.h ever changes, these tests
# must adapt, the test file must be regenerated, and the .phpt --EXPECT--
# sections changed.
#
# To use this configuration from test cases, add these lines to the .phpt file:
# --INI--
# defcon.config-file = tests/backtick_error03.conf
